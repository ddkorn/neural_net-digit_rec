# Using neural network to recognize handwritten digits

Simple two-layer fully-connected neural network. This network is trained on a MNIST dataset and is able to recognize handwritten digits in images with an accuracy of 94 percent on hold-out set.PCA was used for dimensionality reduction of features to compress array of 784 pixels to 184 principal components. Also added the ability to use custom images for digit prediction.  

I made this when I was playing around with MNIST and trying to understand Deep learning.

The MNIST dataset contains the image data of handwritten digits https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hboV-OLFfazEzV9tRqz7Nf1uoHU9jYO3/view
